# Evolutionary Sudoku Generator

## Project Description

This project implements an evolutionary algorithm capable of generating Sudoku puzzles. The generated Sudokus have the unique property of having only one solution. The aim of this project is to develop a robust and efficient algorithm that creates challenging and unique Sudoku puzzles.

### Key Components

- **Evolutionary Algorithm**: Utilizes genetic algorithms for the optimization and generation of Sudokus.
- **Unique Solutions**: Ensures that each generated Sudoku has exactly one solution.
- **Execution Commands**:
  - To compile the project: `.\compile.sh`
  - To compile and run the project: `.\compile.sh -j`

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Library**: gaLib
